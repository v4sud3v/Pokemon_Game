Pokémon Battle Simulator (C++)

A simple command-line Pokémon-style battle game built in C++.
Two Pokémon take turns using moves like Attack, Heal, and Defend until one of them faints.

The goal of this project is to practice basic C++, OOP concepts, and game logic, while keeping the gameplay fun and easy to follow.

🧩 How the Game Works

Each Pokémon starts with a name, maximum HP, attack power, and defense value.

Each turn, the player chooses one of three moves:

Attack → deals damage (with a 10% chance to land a critical hit for double damage)

Heal → restores some HP (cannot exceed max HP)

Defend → reduces the next incoming attack

The opponent Pokémon picks a random move each turn.

The battle continues until one Pokémon’s HP reaches zero and faints.

The game announces the winner at the end.

🎯 Project Purpose

This project is meant to strengthen:

C++ fundamentals

Object-oriented programming

Thinking in terms of game flow and state

Designing simple systems from scratch

🕹️ Status

This is a small learning project, made for fun and for practicing how to write clean and understandable C++ code while building a simple turn-based battle system.

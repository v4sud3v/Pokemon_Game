# Pokémon Battle Simulator (C++)

A simple command-line Pokémon-style battle game built in C++.  
Two Pokémon take turns using moves like **Attack**, **Heal**, and **Defend** until one of them faints.

## 🧩 How the Game Works
- Each Pokémon has:
  - Name  
  - Max HP  
  - Current HP  
  - Attack power  
  - Defense value  

- Each turn, the player chooses one of three moves:
  - **Attack** – deals damage (10% chance for a critical hit that does double damage)  
  - **Heal** – restores HP up to the Pokémon's max  
  - **Defend** – reduces the damage of the next attack received  

- The enemy Pokémon picks moves randomly.
- The fight continues until one Pokémon’s HP hits zero.
- The surviving Pokémon is declared the winner.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project was created to practice:
- C++ fundamentals  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Simple game logic and turn-based mechanics  
- Designing small systems from scratch

## 🕹️ Status
A small, fun learning project focused on gameplay rather than complexity.  
Designed to help build confidence in writing C++ code independently.
